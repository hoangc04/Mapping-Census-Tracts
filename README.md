# Mapping-Census-Tracts

Uses data from the 2000 census to address the 8.4 percent of the U.S. population who live in low-income neighborhoods that are more than a mile from a supermarket. 

This analysis creates geospatial maps to help understand food access in the state of Washington. This analysis uses three geographic region types: Census tract, County, and State.
